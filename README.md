This small basic project offers to download mp4 videos and mp3 audios from YouTube using the pytube package.

  1 - First you need to select whether you want to download video (1) or audio (2).

  2 - Then you enter the YouTube video link you want to download.

  3 - Then you select the location where you want to save the video.

  During the Download process the video title, size in seconds and download progress are shown. At the end, a message "Download done successfully!" is displayed.

  This project was developed for my grandfather to use. Soon I will create the interface using tkinter.

  You can use this code for educational purposes :)
